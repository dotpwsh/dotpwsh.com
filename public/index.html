            <div class="article--body">Some Terraform projects can grow really big and I can be hard to keep track of which Azure resources are in use. Recently I found myself wanting to know which Azure resources our Terraform project use so that I could document them internally. It could also be helpful in case there has been some major changes to some resources in the azurerm Terraform provider that you want to check.
This, not so little, one-liner will list all azurerm_ and azuread_ resources uniquely in your entire Terraform project if you run it from your root module.</div>

            <div class="article--body">By default, when you use the -InFile parameter of Invoke-RestMethod Powershell will send it as application/octet-stream. In this short article we&rsquo;ll look at how to send that file with multipart/form-data instead which is what most forms on the web use.
To send multipart/form-data with Powershell we can use the -Form parameter which takes a hashtable of fields and values.
I couldn&rsquo;t find a service that would allow us to test file uploads for free, so in this example we&rsquo;re going to use the Confluence Cloud REST API to upload an attachment to a page.</div>

But at the same time, I really love Powershell. I have finally found some usefull Powershell modules that has made me switch completly to Powershell in the terminal.
Colorized Directory Listings The first module I&rsquo;m going to introduce is the Get-ChildItemColor module by Joon Ro (github.com/joonro/Get-ChildItemColor).
This module will override the Out-Default cmdlet and give you colorized directory listings when using Get-ChildItem or ls.</div>

Being serverless means that you dont have to worry about the infrastructure and environment behind it and you will only pay for the capacity that you actually use when the function is running. Traditionally you would have a server that runs 24/7 and consume capacity. Very simplified, serverless will spin up and down as requests comes in.</div>

It’s a shame these beautiful images are hidden in a system folder somewhere in Windows, so today I’m going to show you how you can extract these images with Powershell. You could perfectly do this manually, but since these images change periodically (haven’t found any info on when) its much easier to just run a script.</div>

            <div class="article--body">In this guide we’ll take a look at how you can scan your tenant for “hidden” forwarding rules by using Powershell with Exchange Online.
Why One technique that is common amongs hackers, that gain access to email accounts, is to setup a forwarding rule for all incomming email. That way they can read all new emails sent to the victim without beeing flagget or detected by audit logs. They can also create rules for emails from a specific address that go to a folder the hacker controls, ie password reset emails.</div>
