My name is Mads Moi-Aune. I’m a 30-years old Automation Engineer from Norway 🇳🇴 I like to solve problems through code and spend most of my work doing so. I started learning programming when I was about 12 years old. My journey started with web development in HTML & CSS and PHP. Around the time jQuery became popular I discovered Javascript and thought it was amazing.

At the start of 2015 I started my professional career working in IT support. That's when I discovered Powershell, and I fell stright in love ❤️ For the last 5-6 years I’ve mostly worked with Javascript and Powershell doing Servicedesk/Operations work managing Microsoft 365, Azure and Windows alongside developing applications in ServiceNow. Recently I transitioned to a more DevOps focusing role, deploying Infrastructure-as-Code, building pipelines and platform tooling both in Go and of course Powershell. I’m existed to see what the comming years have to offer 😎
