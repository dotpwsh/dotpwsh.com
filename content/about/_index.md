My name is Mads Moi-Aune. I’m a Automation Engineer from Norway in my early 30s. I like to solve problems through code. I started learning programming when I was about 12 years old. My journey started with web development in HTML & CSS and PHP. Around the time jQuery became popular I discovered Javascript and thought it was amazing.

At the start of 2015 I started my professional career working in IT support. That's when I discovered PowerShell and all the amazing things you could do with it and I fell straight in love. I've been eagerly following the development from PowerShell 5.1 to PowerShell Core (now PowerShell 7) and I think it's a promising tool for both Windows AND *nix systems. I'm excited for the day when PowerShell get's more widespread adoption!

For the last years I’ve mostly worked with Go, Javascript and PowerShell building internal tooling, doing platform engineering and seting up infrastructure-as-code alongside developing applications in ServiceNow. My main experience is in the Microsoft ecosystem working with Azure, Microsoft 365, Microsoft Graph etc..
